# IP Address Tracker: IP address and domain information
IP Address Tracker provides location on a map, city, region, timezone and internet service provider(ISP) information of any IP address you search.
IP Address Tracker is a React App that provides information on an IP address or domain that you search. Key information include IP address' or domain's exact location on a map, city, region, timezone and internet service provider(ISP).
IP Address Tracker is a React App that allows a user to enter an IP address or domain and view its geographical information on a map, its timezone and ISP information.
## Overview
On the first load, the app shows your own IP address' region, city, timezone, ISP and loads its location on the map. Every subsequent search for a specific IP Address or domain will update all the information on the page including the map. The user can zoom in and out of the map for a better view.
### Functionality and Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My Process
### Built with

This application was first built using vanilla JavaScript only. In this step I used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Parcel Bundler

I later converted it to a React application.

### What I learned
- Migrating from Parcel bundler to webpack 4. I learned how to adapt the projects file structure based on how different bundlers handle entry points.
- CSS Grid is better than Flexbox when creating layout that should be consistent when content is dynamic on each search.
- Working with Map API.
